        <p className="bold">
          Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to
          predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and
          time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for
          millennia and formally since the 19th century. <br></br><br></br>
          Weather forecasts are
          made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the
          atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology to project how the
          atmosphere will change at a given place. <br></br><br></br>
          Once calculated manually
          based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather
          conditions, and sky condition or cloud cover, weather forecasting now
          relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors
          into account. <br></br><br></br>
          Human input is still required to pick the best possible
          forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern
          recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance,
          and knowledge of model biases
